# README

This is my first Ruby on Rails application.  I created this as a learning experiment, and it is not entirely unlike the blog application created here:  http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html.

I wanted to do something a little bit more fun and useful, so I created this app for storing and managing cooking recipes.  Frankly, I get tired of looking through a bunch of bookmarks, documents, and books to find whatever recipe I want to make.  Also, with a lot of recipes, I often make different adjustments and adapt them while cooking.  The purpose of this app is to keep recipes in one place.  It includes forms for creating and editing recipes and a comments section for adding notes and adjustments.

* Versions
Ruby - 2.3.3
Rails - 5.1.4

This was developed using Puma (3.10.0) and SQLite (3.8.7.2)

* Installing Rails
Following the instructions here to install Rails if necessary:  http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#installing-rails

* Starting the RecipeBox web app
These instructions are for Windows users.
1. Open a command prompt in the bin directory.
2. Type "rails server" without the quotes.
3. Open a web browser and go to localhost:3000 or which server and port you decide to use.

* Authentication
This site uses basic authentication.  The username is "jen" and the password is "secret".  I intend to add better authentication to this app.
